    <h1>Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)</h1>
    <p>
        VAPT is a comprehensive security testing process that helps identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in your computer systems, networks, and applications. It involves both manual and automated techniques to assess the security posture of your infrastructure. The goal of VAPT is to uncover potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers and provide recommendations to mitigate them.

    <h1>Security Operations Center (SOC) Services</h1>
    <p>
        A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized unit that monitors, detects, and responds to cybersecurity incidents and threats. SOC services include continuous monitoring of networks and systems, threat intelligence analysis, incident response, and vulnerability management. A SOC helps organizations proactively protect their information assets, detect security incidents in real-time, and respond swiftly to minimize the impact of security breaches.
